32K String Thing- Insights
--------------------------
You should not use the Hive STRING data type with SAS. Every time you read a STRING column into SAS it results in a 32,767 character column. We saw how it wastes diskspace.

This problem manifests itself when the tables are created outside of SAS. When SAS creates the table you will not experience the 32K String Thing.

We didn't cover it, but you can use DBMAX_TEXT= to help with this. It limits the size of STRING columns (when they are returned to SAS) that are created in SAS. It is not a great solution because it still wastes diskspace. It is better than nothing.

It is far better to use the VARCHAR type in Hive tables.

SAS uses Hive extended table attributes to mitigate this. You saw an example of this.
